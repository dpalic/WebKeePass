WebKeePass
==========

Fork of the previous sourceforge project http://sourceforge.net/projects/webkeepass/files/ since the SF project has no repository.
You will find a git branch for every imported ZIP-file of SourceForge. I tried to keep to track all moves in the project to provide you the maximum transparency of my import to github.

Imported versions: all from 1.070527 till 17.09.2014
